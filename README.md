### What I learned

Media queries: use to apply styles condionally

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  .element {
    /* Apply some styles */
  }
}
```

CSS filter property: adjust contrast, saturation, and brightness

```css
img {
  filter: contrast(.87) saturate(0.99) brightness(1.2);
}
```


### Continued development

Didn't focus on Mobile-first workflow
